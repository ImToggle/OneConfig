    "big": "Seriously, THANK YOU everyone, for your support not just in these past few days, but the weeks and months prior. Every community has some pretty big milestones, the first hundred, five hundred, but one thousand is probably the most important of all. We won't give you all a boring history lecture, or cry about how far we've come, but we will show our appreciation to everyone who's helped made this possible. Our moderators, contributors, the current and past team members, especially Diamond and Moon. So many people with so many ideas and so many passions have put so much time into this project, just-- thank you. I've never been in a better community before. Alright that's enough of this, let's get into the good stuff. What's coming next?\n\n**ONECONFIG**\nWe've basically finished the first major OneConfig update, which is going to include many UI/UX improvements, and a few highly requested features. We actually read your suggestions, so please post anything you'd like to see. Some of these features have been pushed to the pre-release branch for a while now, but there's still more to come. Maybe even in a day or two! Looking further beyond, we plan to support more Minecraft versions in the near future, and add even more options and features. Lots to come!\n\n**POLYUI**\nSo we haven't talked much about this yet, but it's basically the key to all of our future projects. We've learned a lot about UIs and design systems since the start of OneConfig, and it's about time we build our own UI engine. We won't get into the boring details, but it'll be used for both or JVM and Web projects, and be the tool that allows us to rapidly produce new features and updates. (its blazingly fast memory safe)\n\n**ONELAUNCHER**\nThere still isn't a lot to publically say yet. A lot of progress has been made on the backend, but designs haven't been locked in yet, and we've still got a long way to do. (This idiot cal won't just give the design). Not much has been leaked yet because it's basically a bunch of cli, yuck boring. Once designs start coming out we'll be sharing everything that is being worked on.\n\nThank you once again for 1k! alr bai",
